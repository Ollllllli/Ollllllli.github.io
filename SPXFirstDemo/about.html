	<h1>About</h1>
	<maincontent>
		<p>Minecraft is a sandbox adventure based game made in the autumn of 2009. </p>
		<p>It was made by a Swedish developer known as Notch, who quickly made a name for himself and built up a team of people to work with him. </p>
		<p>The game is set in a randomly generated, near infinite world, that you can explore, fight monsters in, search for diamonds to make the best armour, and ultimately defeat the end game boss, the Ender Dragon.</p>
		<p>Originally, Notch(and his fellow dev, Jeb) and his team owned Minecraft, under the company; Mojang. However, a few years ago Microsoft bought ownership of Mojang.</p>
